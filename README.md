# explorer

explorer is a shiny app for all the R packages created at Rsquared 
Academy. The idea is to assist enable new users of the R language to 
interactively explore the packages before they master R. Currently, the app 
supports the [descriptr](https://rsquaredacademy.github.io/descriptr/)
package.
